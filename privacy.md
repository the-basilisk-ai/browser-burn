# Privacy policy

At BasiliskAI, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our BrowserBurn Chrome Extension ("Extension"). By using the Extension, users agree to these terms.

## 1. Information We Collect and How We Use It

We do not store or collect any personally identifiable information about our users. The Extension only accesses the recent browsing history page titles, limited to the last two hours of use. The Extension does not store browsing history. The Extension does not transfer any browsing history beyond page titles. This information is used to personalize roast content and enhance the user experience. All browsing history collected is discarded once used to generate a roast.

The Extension uses local browser storage to save the users' preference for dark/light mode and 12/24 hour clock display. This information is stored locally on a users device, and we do not have access to it.

It is important to note that the OpenAI v1 chat completions API is used to generate roast content based on page titles accessed by the Extension. Users should refer to the OpenAI Privacy Policy document for information on how they collect, use, and disclose information. BasiliskAI takes no responsibility for data handling by OpenAI once data has been transferred from the Extension to OpenAI via API.

## 2. Disclosure of Information

We do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about our users to any third party. We do not intentionally collect any personally identifiable information about our users. We are unable to disclose user information if required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, as we do not collect any.

## 3. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect about our users from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems.

## 4. Children's Privacy

The Extension is not intended for children under the age of 13, as the roast content may not be suitable for their viewing.

## 5. Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on this page, and the revised Privacy Policy will be effective when it is posted.
